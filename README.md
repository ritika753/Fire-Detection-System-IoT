# Fire-Detection-System-IoT
This project is a smart fire detection system that senses both **smoke** and **flame**, and sends real-time alerts and visual data using IoT integration. The system was built using an Arduino-compatible microcontroller, and I also designed a **custom PCB** to make it compact and hardware-ready.
## 📌 Key Features
- 🧪 **Dual detection**: Detects smoke (using MQ-2 sensor) and flame (using IR flame sensor)
- 📡 **ThingSpeak Integration**: Sends real-time data to the ThingSpeak platform for graphical visualization
- 📧 **Email Alerts (SMTP)**: Automatically sends email alerts when fire is detected
- 🧾 **Custom PCB**: Designed and fabricated a custom PCB to replace the breadboard prototype
- ⚠️ **Threshold-based warning system**: Alert is triggered only when predefined danger levels are crossed
